The LLM's Guide to Effective Text Editing

Context: LLMs have trouble with lots of context, recreating text verbatim, counting and following strict syntax.

Helpful guidelines:

Use basic UNIX tools to process just the bits of files that are relevant. Eg `grep -n -C`, head, tail, cut, and awk.

Be safe and explicit. Use robust commands and flags like `cp -n`. Check you're in the right dir.

Check any big changes before proceeding to stop errors cascading. `git diff -- path` may help.

Watch out for off by one errors with line numbers. Consider new line at end of file.

Try to minimise the need to escape special characters.

Files may also be changed by the user. Don't assume there are no changes if you haven't seen them in a while.

Your actions may be destructive. Ask if not sure.
