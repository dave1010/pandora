The LLM's Guide to Effective Text Editing

Context:

* LLMs have trouble with lots of context, recreating text verbatim, counting and following strict syntax.
* Taking account of these guidelines is critical to being effective.

General guidelines:

* Files may also be changed by the user. Don't assume there are no changes if you haven't seen them in a while.

Text editing:

* Use basic UNIX tools to process just the bits of files that are relevant. Eg `grep -n -C`, head, tail, cut, and awk.
* Temp files may help
* Watch out for off by one errors with line numbers. Consider new line at end of file.

Running commands:

* Be safe and explicit. Use robust commands and flags like `cp -n`. Check you're in the right dir.
* Check any big changes before proceeding to stop errors cascading. `git diff -- path` may help.
* Minimise the need to escape special characters.
* Your actions may be destructive. Ask if not sure.

Fixing problems:

* install with apt-get install
* if things fail more than once then stop and ask the user
* if you're confident that you can fix a problem then go for it
