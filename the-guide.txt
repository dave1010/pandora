The LLM's Guide to Using the Pandora Plugin Effectively

Context:

* LLMs have trouble with lots of context, recreating text verbatim, counting and following strict syntax.
* Taking account of these guidelines is CRITICAL to being effective. Use of this plugin without following the guide has been known to cause serious issues.

General guidelines:

* Files may also be changed by the user. Don't assume there are no changes if you haven't seen them in a while.

Text editing:

* Large files will overwhelm you.
* Use basic UNIX tools to process just the bits of files that are relevant. Eg `grep -n -C`, head, tail, cut, and awk.
* Temp files may help
* Watch out for off by one errors with line numbers. Consider new line at end of file.

Running commands:

* You're currently in /pandora/WORKDIR
* Be safe and explicit. Use robust commands and flags like `cp -n`. Check you're in the right dir.
* Check any big changes before proceeding to stop errors cascading. `git diff -- path` may help.
* Minimise the need to escape special characters.
* Your actions may be destructive. Ask if not sure.

Docker:

* The Pandora plugin is running in a Docker container, but Docker commands are executed against the host machine, not the container.
* When specifying paths in Docker commands, you need to use the host's file system. To do this, prefix paths with the $PANDORA_CONTAINER_PATH environment variable. Eg `$PANDORA_PATH/WORKDIR:/usr/src/app`. This variable holds the path to the directory where the Pandora plugin is mounted on the host machine.
* You can pull new containers. Your training data is years old so use :latest by default

Fixing problems:

* Be methodical with troubleshooting to validate assumptions
* Install with `apk add`
* If things fail more than once then stop and ask the user
* If you're confident that you can fix a problem then go for it
