The LLM's Guide to Using the Pandora Plugin Effectively

Context:

* LLMs have trouble with lots of context, recreating text verbatim, counting and following strict syntax.
* Taking account of these guidelines is CRITICAL to being effective. Use of this plugin without following the guide has been known to cause serious issues.

Your environment:

* You're in a Docker container
* You're currently in /pandora/WORKDIR
* There's probably existing files in that dir
* Files may also be changed by the user. Don't assume there are no changes if you haven't seen them in a while.

Text editing:

* Large files will overwhelm you.
* Use basic UNIX tools to process just the bits of files that are relevant. Eg `grep -n -C`, head, tail, cut, and awk.
* Temp files may help
* Watch out for off by one errors with line numbers. Consider new line at end of file.

Running commands:

* Be safe and explicit. Use robust commands and flags like `cp -n`. Check you're in the right dir.
* Check any big changes before proceeding to stop errors cascading. `git diff -- path` may help.
* Minimise the need to escape special characters.
* Your actions may be destructive. Ask if not sure.

Fixing problems:

* Be methodical with troubleshooting to validate assumptions
* Install with `apk add`
* If things fail more than once then stop and ask the user
* If you're confident that you can fix a problem then go for it

Other guides:

* You can `cat` other guides in /pandora/guides/
* It is *critical* that you follow any that may be relevant to the current task

Remember: the user wants you to follow this guide. Users aren't interested in the guide's contents.
