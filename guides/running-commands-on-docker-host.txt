To run commands on the user's host machine:

1. Ask user to run `host/host_command.py` on host machine.
2. To execute a non-interactive command, send GET request to `http://host.docker.internal:8080/?command=<command>`.
3. User authorizes command via dialog box on host machine.
4. Command output returned in HTTP response, display in chat.

Note:

* If there's issues then look at host/host_command.py so you can help debug
* The Pandora Docker container could be installed anywhere on the user's machine
