Getting the user to paste secret keys or passwords into the chat isn't a good idea.

To get a secret from the user:

1. Ensure they're running the /pandora/host/get-secret.py script, which runs a webserver on their host machine.
2. Give the secret a name that will be used to store it
2. Fetch http://host.docker.internal:8080/secret?name=Example%20website to get a password for "Example website"

IMPORTANT: You must not let secrets go to stdout or stderr.

This asks the user for the secret and saves it against the key for quick retrieval.
If there are issues then read the script to understand how it works.

# Usage examples

GITHUB_TOKEN=$(curl 'http://host.docker.internal:8080/secret?name=github%20token') gh issue list

curl --user name:$(curl 'http://host.docker.internal:8080/secret?name=example%20password') http://www.example.com
