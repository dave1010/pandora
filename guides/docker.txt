Docker:

The Pandora plugin is running in a Docker container,
but Docker commands are executed against the host machine, not the container.

When specifying paths in Docker commands, you need to use the host's file system.
To do this, prefix paths with the $PANDORA_CONTAINER_PATH environment variable.
Eg `$PANDORA_PATH/WORKDIR:/usr/src/app`.
This variable holds the path to the directory where the Pandora plugin is mounted on the host machine.

You can pull new containers. Your training data is years old so use :latest by default.
